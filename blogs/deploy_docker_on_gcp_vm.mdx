title: Deploy Containers on GCP Compute Engine

description: In this I will take you through deploying a docker container on a GCP compute engine 
---

I wanted to deploy an application on docker because it is bugging me why I am not using docker as I have heard a lot about how it eases the deployment process of modern software, so I decided to do the labour work and tried to figure out how to do it (The docker community on dicord is amazing). I am fairly new to the container world and I just wanted to put this blog up on my personal portfolio so that i can look cool and have all the SEO in the Google Search Engine....
<br/>
Oh sorry, we are here to deploy the application more specifically an application that is running inside a container.
Attention!!! This is not an advance level stuff just some learning that i did and wanted to share for myself. Just a solipsistic person here.
<br/>
Step 1: Write a Dockerfile in the root of your project, I am using a simple vite-react application 
for deployment because I am a simple person. You can clone the <a href={"https://github.com/gaurav-2-0-0-2/vite-docker-gcp"}>project</a> if you love your time.
<br/>
Now run these:
<br/>
```
cd vite-docker-gcp
npm install
npm run dev
```
<br/>
Your application is running on http://localhost:5173, go check in your browser. In the root of your project create a Dockerfile. A dockerfile is necessary to build an image of the application. An image is like a blueprint for the container. We are going to use this image to run our container and the amazing thing is you can run multiple containers with the same image, awesome. 
<br/>
```Dockerfile

FROM node:20-alpine as base
WORKDIR ./src 
COPY package*.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
npm i -g serve
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["serve", "-s", "dist"]

```
<br/>
What is happening ?
<ul style={{ paddingLeft:'40px', listStyleType: 'dot' }}>
    <li>We are pulling a node:20-alpine image from docker hub</li>
    <li>Telling docker, set working directory inside the container to src/</li>
    <li>Copying package.json and package-lock.json in docker image's filesystem</li>
    <li>Running npm install to install dependecies at build time</li>
    <li>Copying the files in docker image's filesystem</li>
    <li>Building our application (this will give us a dist folder)</li>
    <li>Exposing the port 3000 </li>
    <li>CMD command always run inside a container, so we are going to serve our dist using this command</li>
</ul> 
<br/>
Note: This is enough to build the image
