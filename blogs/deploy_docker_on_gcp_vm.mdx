description: In this I will take you through deploying a docker container on a GCP compute engine 
---

I wanted to deploy an application on docker because it is bugging me why I am not using docker as I have heard a lot about how it eases the deployment process of modern software, so I decided to do the labour work and tried to figure out how to do it (The docker community on dicord is amazing). I am fairly new to the container world and I just wanted to put this blog up on my personal portfolio so that i can look cool and have all the SEO in the Google Search Engine....
<br/>
Oh sorry, we are here to deploy the application more specifically an application that is running inside a container.
Attention!!! This is not an advance level stuff just some learning that i did and wanted to share for myself. Just a solipsistic person here.
<br/>
Step 1: Write a Dockerfile in the root of your project, I am using a simple vite-react application 
for deployment because I am a simple person. You can clone the <a href={"https://github.com/gaurav-2-0-0-2/vite-docker-gcp"}>project</a> if you love your time.
<br/>
Now run these:
<br/>
```
cd vite-docker-gcp
npm install
npm run dev
```
<br/>
Your application is running on http://localhost:5173, go check in your browser. In the root of your project create a Dockerfile.
<br/>
```Dockerfile

```
